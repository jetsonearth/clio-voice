Meeting Title: Clio Voice product exploration with potential VC investor
Date: Aug 15

Transcript:
 
Them: Roman numerals. And, we are pre previously known as the Capital in Southeast Asia and India. We have been around for twenty years, so investing across in this region and and globally. And, you know, we we invest anywhere from idea to IPO. So we're multistage. I specifically focused my time on early stage working with early stage founders. So that means, like, seed series a thing of, like, companies that have just an idea all the way to a couple of million dollars in in revenue. And, you know, like, I mostly spend my time around software AI at the price tag, etcetera. My my initial you know, why I was curious to to chat with you is because of the of Cleo. Cleo Voice, the the product that you have you have built. Since it's really interesting, we actually our colleagues in India evaluated this company called Whisperflow. I'm pretty sure you know the this company and  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: we like this category a lot. I've been trying to figure out when should we be partnering. Right? Is it, like, right now, or is it later in the stages I think that's still an open question. But just on a category, we believe that look, there's gonna be a certain set of use cases that, people would just use voice by default and not type in.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: It could be more efficient. Right? We're trying to figure that out. Right? Like, the behavior change would take some time, but, it's a like, all things, it's it's always a hypothesis and seeing whether this hypothesis comes true. So that's that's kind of like the background. I I spent the last seven years in in VC.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: It's my you know, I've spent two over here and then previously at the corp dev. But most of my six, seven years has been most focusing on software. So, yeah, let me pause then, see if you have any questions.  
Me: One of your previous colleague Adamy, on LinkedIn too, you're you're previous company.  
Them: Previous clinics,  
Me: Your so your previous company you you work at a VC.  
Them: Oh, January capital? Yeah.  
Me: Rain Raynard Lau. I'm not sure  
Them: Raynaud. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's yeah. I think look. We I think we follow each other all the time. So so this this you know, is I don't think it's a coincidence. It's  
Me: It's it's funny. I just updated my LinkedIn because I don't come on LinkedIn. And then  
Them: Yes.  
Me: good.  
Them: So we yeah. I mean, as you can imagine, like, it's our job to  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: to figure out who's building and, you know, catch them in the early stages and  
Me: For sure. Thanks so much for figuring  
Them: see if there's a chance to partner.  
Me: connecting, and I'll just give you some brief stuff built this product months ago, like, six months ago. For my own use. I I I was using my local just locally, like myself. A couple friends asked me if, I'll be interested releasing. Polishing up, and then just for them to use. So I just like, hey. Sure. And then I saw I saw Whisperflow. Raised a lot of money. Voice AI space. It's like, okay. Might be able to give it a shot and maybe build a more serious business. So that's kind of how I take it. I fine tune my model for Chinese mixed Chinese English language,  
Them: Okay.  
Me: also Japanese and Korean. So English is really good too, but I'm right now, like, my my wedge would probably  
Them: Okay.  
Me: be the Asian market. So Japanese, Korean you know, on x, there's a lot  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: of Japanese users. They're really in AI.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: They're super into AI. So like my initial wedge. I'm not really well, US is a big market, but maybe at this point, not spending too much time just trying to against the WhisperFlow. Or Willow, like the other companies who are well funded.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So I can find my wedge. So and right now, I'm I'm doing beta testing. I have users just  
Them: Next.  
Me: working with me to fix some bugs and get some feedback. So  
Them: I see. What what are people typically  
Me: kinda where right now.  
Them: what do people typically use you for? Like, what's the what are  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: early beta users? How are they like? Yeah.  
Me: Pretty much the persona, like like myself. Who spend a lot time talking to AI. Know, with Cursor, ClockCo, you spend so much time typing? In context. Feel like so in in the future, programming would be engineering would be, like, project management. Right? You're not the one that's writing the code, but you are collabing with AI to talk through, like, form and documents. Know, it's kinda like you were writing product product requirement documents. So that's that's where their use case is right now.  
Them: So  
Me: Spending a lot time talking to coding agents.  
Them: So, like, the people who are using Clio are also using plot code and, cursor.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: And the way that they're using it how how are they using it? Is it mostly to generate PRDs and or is it or is it, you know, you have an ID and, you know, they just talk as if, like, they're prompting the the cursor.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: To to generate code.  
Me: Absolutely. And then yes, through prompting and then messaging as well. I always, like, use my tool to comment on tweets, messaging on WeChat, because I I I could I could say, like, in more personalized mode. You  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: learn how I text or email people.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So it's, you know, like what I wanted to say So yeah.  
Them: Oh, wow. Okay. Got it. So so mostly, it it could seems like but today, the the use cases are more, developer centric. If I understand you correctly.  
Me: Initial wedge is but you think about who spend most time talking to AI at the moment. Right? It's it's coding. And that's where all the LLM that's where AI is having the most product market fit. It's coding use case. It's not yet maybe  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: three d, like, blender design or other stuff. No. It's where people spend the most time. And coders a lot of, you know, chatting with AI because consumers, you know, they spend a lot of time creating, so that makes sense. So that's that's one part, you know, using for dictation, but other thing, you know, I'm working into it is so what what I what you say, what you dictate could be used as a prompt. Prompt, you know, things like like a GUI agent or or use it to write email. So maybe you like your email and just like, hey. Cleo. Can you write me a friendly comment to reply to this person? So of use it like a  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: much smarter Siri. Use it to do a of other yeah.  
Them: So it's like it's like like, if you have if you're using complexity or manners you know, all of that, you can you're actually saying something, and then it  
Me: Yeah. That's that's an  
Them: goes into the as a prompt. Comes up to?  
Me: that's an extraction. Yeah. So if you but you are Asia but I I don't I haven't found a lot of  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: use case or application for that. That ramp, maybe in the future, but  
Them: Right.  
Me: the moment, you know, just mostly dictation kinda to replace keyboard.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: To replace some, like, typing. And also, I wanted to write  
Them: Sure. Yeah.  
Me: So I I tweaked a lot. I share, like, a lot of my learnings. Building products and working with AI. And and I just kind of think better, like, when I when when I speak, I free flow. Right? I some gets stopped.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So it's better than timing. For my for my use case.  
Them: Got it. And maybe helpful to walk through the the product. Right? It's in terms of, like, what have you built and for I I don't know if there is level of customization that you have done,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: specifically for a a particular use case. Let's say if you're looking at developers and as the initial ICP, You know, what what have you done that's specific to their profile profile and their usage habits?  
Me: Yeah. Why don't I just walk you through my software? I have it on I'll share my screen.  
Them: Yeah. I actually tried it, by the way. So I think it's  
Me: It's a little buggy, but  
Them: yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But but look. It it works well. I mean, I would say latency needs some fixing for sure, but, like, I think I think it does did a pretty good job at understanding what we're trying to say. Right? Like, SaaS is, like, you know, the way it's being spelled is correct. And they they picked up, like, pick 15 and, you know, stuff like that. So this is it's good.  
Me: Did you have problem with latency?  
Them: Latency, well, I  
Me: Usually, one second. If it's already  
Them: yep.  
Me: right now, I I don't have a lot of I I'm not trying to get pump up the servers, that's that's why. But  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: my I use it most most of the time is one second.  
Them: Once again. Okay.  
Me: So when I when I do mix English and Chinese, can build, like, one minute of audio I compare that with WhisperFlow. WhisperFlow takes up to ten seconds usually eight to ten seconds, but my usually takes  
Them: Right.  
Me: second.  
Them: One second. Okay. Interesting.  
Me: Have a Yeah. Yeah. So  
Them: We yeah. So we we actually tried it earlier, and we essentially dictate a a paragraph, like, introducing p 50 and I think it took a few seconds, but I think it's, yeah. Which is why we thought it could be somewhat real time, but, yeah, which is why we under we need to understand the the product matter, like, how the product is being  
Me: Definitely worth some fine tuning, I'll definitely get back to you.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I'll I'll fix it because maybe, like, when you when you start the app or when it wakes wakes up, like, not using it, you it it kinda takes a little bit while, like, for the first, like, cold start.  
Them: Let's see.  
Me: But but, like, set up a persistent connection. So  
Them: Okay.  
Me: using WebSocket. Right? Because send audio.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Warm.  
Them: I see.  
Me: Then you don't pay, like, the connection cost. Probably why I I'll fix it, I'll I'll I'll let you know.  
Them: Alright. No. No. No. All good. I mean I mean, it's it's just something that we we we picked up and I think it's also, like, for instance, the the translation from colloquial language to written language, right, is also done pretty decently as well. Right? How do you make it like it's not being spoken but being written think that's something that yeah.  
Me: People there there are people preferring, like, it remaining spoken, especially in messaging. In Discord or in on x or in WeChat  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: when you're trying to be casual, because right now, it kinda just  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: default to right in one style. So everyone everyone dictate, everyone has different style of typing. But right now when you dictate, it kinda it help you polish, but polish in, like, in the same way. So it kinda, like, official.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I I sound like a 50 year old when I when I write to my my write to my my friend. Because I don't use punctuations when I type. Right? But  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: it it punctuation. So that's some personalization to get that Flincoln app.  
Them: I see.  
Me: My feature list. So, well, in terms of your question,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: yeah, so I when I detect people that are using they're typing in cursor or windsurf or terminal, it would turn on a code mode. So I I set up, like, know, fine tune the for that specific use case, it's able to pick up technical terms better. Can actually tag files, like when I that's the latest feature of WhisperFlow. I I built it already. We say the file name, you know, it can it can attack the file. So Curser has the the right context And Okay. Just mostly when when you try to dictate stuff like clock code, generics dictation tool can can get that, but I I know I I built it. So it can recognize stuff like that. When you when developers are are coding. So  
Them: I see. So so it's if I hear you right, catering to developers as as the first market and how you do that is by fine tuning the audio models.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Right, to our specific it depends on, like, what's the dataset that goes in, but seems like it's a lot of technical terms and speak. And and what else on top of that that have you customized based on the developer persona?  
Me: Now that that's pretty much it. You don't  
Them: This  
Me: another thing that a user has has me about is he's trying to find a way of kind of so his his when he talks to AI, he kinda doesn't have a clear idea of, like, he wants. So he's, like, probably 80% clear. He's hoping that that prompting, AI can Cleo can help him polish or output a set of prompts, like technical prompt, that is ready to go So when you plug into the cursor, they're ready to code it for you. So some kind of building technical clarity. So that's that's how I would put it.  
Them: I see. So when right. Okay. The the so from based on what you said, my understanding is, like, might not be very clear in my train of thought, and I might just, like, you know, say some gibberish. You know? A bit because, like, we are always thinking on the fly. Right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Even now it's like there's a bit of stuttering. We I I don't know what I'm saying. You're saying that Cleo will condense this and without changing the meaning of it. But give you that straight line sort of fluent way of the the the words that could be included into a technical prompt.  
Me: Absolutely. So think of clear as, like, a a like, technical product manager that knows the business people's  
Them: You know?  
Me: like, what the business side want. Then convert that to engineering language. So that's kinda the level I'm kinda tech taking it up to. And yes. And you you you caught it perfectly. It's not to try to transcribe, whatever you say. That's what Windows or Mac does. Right? The the built in.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Dictation tool. But it's it's supposed to transcribe what you meant to say, so what you intend to say. Not what you said literally. So because we What do think? We have a lot of chunk. We might self correct. We might have fluen this fluencies, have stuttering. So it's gonna remove all pretty much all all those stuff.  
Them: I see. Okay. Interesting. And and does it  
Me: I  
Them: in your mind, is it mostly fine tuning work that has to be done on this one, or it's a lot of, like, trial and error just to get this part right?  
Me: Yeah. And then the other thing would be well, the precise model or the other thing is inference Right? So finding a way to really make the inference very, very fast, that's actually really critical to a user experience. And also another feature a ton of features I'm I'm building in. For example, memory,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: and auto adding the dictionary. So I can right now, I have feature in in in I'm I'm cooking up is when after you dictate, maybe after sometimes and when user actually corrects something, you will recognize that, oh, maybe we spelled that wrong. So we we, auto add that dictionary to the audio model. So that's a level of personalization to recognize some some terms that are specific to the user. So I think personalization is really, really important. So  
Them: Sure.  
Me: how do you output a draft or transcript that's really personal to the users, like tone,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: and kind of experience, that's that's really critical. And also recognizing  
Them: Right.  
Me: users' terms. So these are the two directions.  
Them: Right. Okay. Gotcha. So I think mostly it's also, like, inference and personalization is what you want to perfect. For the to to start with its developers. Actually, I'm curious on the the users who have who are who who are on your platform right now, How did they find out about you, and what's the typical sort of use case? Like, why do they want to change their habits from typing to voice? Is it oh, I mean, I've asked that earlier, but I guess what I'm trying to ask in a specific manner is that is there anything that the that they think that it could be done better in voice as opposed to typing. Is that a a prompting? Is that, like, just writing code?  
Me: Yeah. That's a great question. That's something I need to interview more people on, but I'll answer your first question.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I I have I I I build contents in China, like on Red Notes and on WeChat. I have about 40,000 followers, that's I I just call  
Them: Nice.  
Me: my my followers. I like, 30 of them. Also I I hang out on x quite a lot because that's where pretty much AI founders find product market fifth.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And find that. So I do a lot of call calling and then  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: of unscalable stuff, very messy stuff  
Them: Yeah. That's fine.  
Me: to FaceTime users. How I I find users. Moment.  
Them: I see. Okay. So mostly outbound and mostly a developer profile.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Think? Okay. Gotcha. And  
Me: Developers are also more prone to adopt, newer tools.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Why, you know, you wanna start with developers first.  
Them: Exactly. Yeah. No. We we we invest in a lot of dev tools. You know, we're investors of super base. And, you know, there are others, like, VoIP zero, which is like a VEED project, you know, the front end front front end tool called VEED. We we also, you know, invest in that. So I agree with you that developers are they always like the know, to try new things, new tools, and when it works, they tend to stick with them. Right? And they don't they usually don't like to be  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: sold. Right? They they like to buy things. Yeah. Which is why, like, this whole notion of, like, hey. Actually, if people found sign you organically, what can spread very fast within the developer community?  
Me: Yep. 100%.  
Them: Right? And super sticky. Right? They almost consider it as a religion  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: know, if they swear by, like, cloth coat or stuff like that. So, yeah, it could be it could be interesting. We've developers as the file source ICP to go after  
Me: And, yeah, the the other thing is, G Yeah, the the other thing is geography. Right? So Japan, Korea, and not Chinese China Mainland because people in in Mainland don't really have great  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: willingness to pay compared to going abroad. So but focusing on Chinese, like, living in The States or elsewhere.  
Them: Right. Okay. Got it. Okay. And is it have have you seen, like, behavior changes, like, in some of your early users what I meant is, like, how long have they you know, are they using it in a typical setting? Have you witnessed any signs of, like, hey. Who actually prefer to do more voice than typing now  
Me: It's it's too early to have a meaningful data for you, but love to connect with you, you know, down the road.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  
Me: More. Sorry. One one more kind of context I'll give it to you is I I've noticed a lot of users of mine, dictate first. So so they used to type something  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: or they used the Apple building dictation. Then they it in ChatGPT to make it better. Sounds nicer. And then they'll paste that. So that's kinda like, like, context switching. But, they will hook up the LLM, like, right after that transcript. So you you get rid of know, the need to kinda do switching  
Them: No. The boat tools and stuff like that. Basically, you're talking to  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: you're talking to Cleo. Cleo will it's it's back to the value proposition. It's like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: extracting what you meant to say. It's not like the the, like, just ex it's not a dumb, like, speech to text.  
Me: No. No. The  
Them: Pipe that you're doing. Right? It's semantically we I'm I'm curious which model are you using underneath the wood that powers this?  
Me: I fine tune my model further using Whisper. And I've tried another one with Ali Baba's performer. There there's other models out there that are really useful. Right now they're too big. To so MISTRO released a a model that's performing quite well, the inference will be will be expensive. So not at this stage, you know, later on.  
Them: So right now is Alibaba's open source, and then, obviously, Respira is is opening eyes product  
Me: Most most pretty much every company that you see building application I'm not talking about  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: or other companies, but these Whisperflow, all the  
Them: Right.  
Me: companies, they're they're using Whisper. Create  
Them: Right.  
Me: I I can tell  
Them: Okay. Interesting. Now what I thought it's like yeah. Okay.  
Me: No. You you would know because when you transcribe Chinese, it makes 50% traditional Chinese and 50% simplified Chinese. I've I've tested all the all the tools out there. They do that for Chinese.  
Them: You know?  
Me: But I I I built something different. So it's right now, it's focusing on  
Them: Dublify trainings? Okay.  
Me: purely simplified Chinese. I I do have some Taiwan user that are interested. So you know, just juggle.  
Them: By the it's okay. Like, now I think the the whole world lives  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: except for Taiwan. They we we live in simplified Chinese. Right? No. Yeah. I don't know. Like, it feels like it.  
Me: Be fine. Sorry.  
Them: I mean, I definitely should be fine with you. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: I'd love to say reserve five minutes at the end just asking you as as a  
Them: Please please ask now. I think I'm I'm done. Look. I'm very curious about the product. I would love to stay in a close touch. You are based out of Singapore. Right?  
Me: I'm actually in Shenzhen.  
Them: Okay. Based out of  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: or  
Me: Yeah. I put because I I'm trying to go abroad, you know,  
Them: okay. Okay. Got it. Got it. Yeah. It's It's  
Me: So I I just moved back from The States. I spent thirteen years there.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: I just moved back, like, earlier this year.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: I have I I'm pushing a port right now because, you know,  
Them: Yes.  
Me: geopolitics stuff. As you Yeah.  
Them: Yes. No. Like, look. We have backed a lot. We have supported a lot of Chinese founders.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Whether it's in China. But but also, there is this obviously, we also backed a lot of them. There are have moved their headquarters to Singapore. Like, I mean,  
Me: Mannace. Is  
Them: yeah, Manas is one. Right? I mean, Manas is in the headlines part, you know,  
Me: yeah.  
Them: underneath that, there's, like, many, many Chinese founders that are that have moved. So it's  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: something that we can definitely, help you even without an, you know, certain investment. We are happy to refer you to someone who might be helpful in this. Like, just getting set up from a where your you and your future, colleagues might be in China. But, HQ in Singapore and SAM globally.  
Me: Yeah. Have to extend the meeting a little bit. I'm not sure if you have the time. Just let me know. Okay.  
Them: Yeah. I do unfortunately, I do have a hot stop at the 04:00. But but let's let come. Like, let's let's yeah. I I think I've asked a lot of questions. So  
Me: That's fine. I'm just gonna treat you as my as my user, and I'm gonna get feedback from you. Okay? Just  
Them: Sure.  
Me: trying to improve the product as much as possible. So latency is something that you that you mentioned. For my use case, sometimes it takes three or four seconds, like,  
Them: Okay.  
Me: one step while because the concurrency and stuff, that that's the server issue. Could be fixed. But just in general, what are you seeing that maybe you have frictions using the product? What do you see that, you know, it's not  
Them: Yeah. So  
Me: it could be improved. Like, just just wanna hear your thoughts.  
Them: Yeah. So disclaimer, I've only used it for ten minutes. Okay? So, like, I and I'm not a developer So I'm I write I write LinkedIn messages like, how I found you. Right? Like, I write LinkedIn messages you use using Clio. Right now. I think it's first of all, I think the punctuation is good.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: So it it's able to capture the punctuation accurately. I think there's always there's I when I tap it in I think it's also because I'm also thinking of what to say next. And sometimes the messages that are displayed, could have a sense of, like, this is spoken. And this is not, like, written. Right? For instance, if I want if I were to write a formal email, formal outreach email to a founder. Right? Hi. My name is Jabia. My I'm from Pick fifteen, formerly known as Sequoia, India and Southeast Asia. We invest across stages from I idea to IPO. And stuff like that. And I always think of what is it what's the next statement to say. It'll it'll come across as as if it's it's it's a it's a bit colloquial.  
Me: Explain what like,  
Them: And so I'll need to  
Me: explain clockwork, please. Like  
Them: So so means means, like, it's it's like we're it's like speak. Right? Right? I think the way you speak and the way type is very different.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: And so sometimes it it comes out, like, as if it's being spoken. Now in WhatsApp and Telegram, all this, I understand. It's totally fine. But if I'm using it for to write emails, on a, you know, on on a formal email. Right? You know, I I think I think that has to be  
Me: So yeah.  
Them: sort of, like, somewhat more structured. Like, how superhuman is. Right? Like, so superhuman does does I mean, it's not exactly voice.  
Me: Do you use it? Okay.  
Them: My friend uses it, but I'm not  
Me: I'm I'm so glad you asked, because this is something I actually built it, but I hide it from the app because I I thought of not giving users too many options. At first,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: then kinda Yeah. Releasing more features. So  
Them: Yeah. Sure.  
Me: the option to your prompt. Giving your you are it knows know, is there JBRR? It is?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Know, your investor, so you like some kind of tone and messaging when you speak to, like, different people. You can also put in prompt of, your favorite author or you know like program. You wanna write like program or send Altman? And it detects that you're on LinkedIn. You're writing emails to founders or you detect you're in WhatsApp it would have different, kind of a So that's I'm super excited. You you're gonna  
Them: Oh, nice. Okay. Then  
Me: I'm so glad So  
Them: then yeah. It's good. It's good. Yeah. Because I think that that look. I'm the I'm I'm using it for more for professional and formal purposes. Right? So  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: and, you know, we could also potentially use it for writing memos investment memos. Right? So you think of, like, the three to five page long memos, like, when we make a case for investment IC, it's always get to it's always good to, pace and, you know, just talk.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: To Cleo, and then it will just come up everything. So so that's that's actually the the holy glow for  
Me: Okay.  
Them: the the people working here, which is, like, if you can help with that's  
Me: I'll I'll send you code  
Them: I think, would be very happy.  
Me: I'll I'll send you codes. You can share with your colleagues, like, maybe later when I polish fix some bugs. Free to use it as much as possible.  
Them: Yeah.
